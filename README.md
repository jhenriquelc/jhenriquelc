## Hiiiii 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [UTFPR](https://utfpr.edu.br), currently trying not to lose my head due to a very busy semester.

## I love developing in:

- 🦀 Rust (with [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap))
- 🐍 Python (with [platformdirs](https://github.com/tox-dev/platformdirs))
- 🟠 Svelte (with [flowbite-svelte](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte))

## Ending notes

Thanks for visiting my profile! Please feel free to have a look around what I've been working on 🤗

In case I don't see you again... good morning, good evening and good night!
